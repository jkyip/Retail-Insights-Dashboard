## Usage

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file `Sales_Analysis_Dashboard.ipynb`.

2. Open the downloaded file in a Jupyter environment.

3. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis step by step.

4. Explore the customer segmentation, product clustering, and other analysis results.

## Analysis Highlights

### Data Extraction and Transformation using SQL

The notebook employs SQL to extract, transform, and aggregate the sales data. It uses SQLite to create an in-memory database and perform data transformations.

### Python Data Analysis and Visualization

Python's data analysis and visualization libraries are used to create visualizations that showcase total sales trends over time and analyze customer segments.

### Customer Segmentation Analysis

The notebook analyzes customer sales data and uses K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It visualizes the top 10 customers by total sales and provides insights into customer segments.

### Clustering Analysis

The project employs K-means clustering to group similar products based on price and quantity ordered, providing insights into product categories and trends.

### Customer Analytics

The analysis calculates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Repeat Purchase Rate for different customer segments, offering insights into customer loyalty and profitability.

### Retail Analytics

The notebook explores sales trends by product category and analyzes monthly sales trends for selected product categories.

## Conclusion

The Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard seamlessly integrates SQL and Python for data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The analysis steps provide valuable insights into customer behavior, product categories, and sales trends, facilitating data-driven decisions and strategic planning in the realm of retail analytics.
